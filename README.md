# TicTacToe
1st Working TicTacToe Game. It is not efficent but its working. That was the goal of this project. It has some error management and a working gameloop.

If you want nothing to do with code then you can only download the 'Play Tic Tac Toe.zip' file. While its downloading it may say that the file is unsafe. But don't worry this is what your device does when it sees a c++ file. All what you have to do it allow it to download then run the 'TicTacToe.exe' file to play the game.

If you have any questions, you can message me on Discord Zswn#8966.

Thanks.
